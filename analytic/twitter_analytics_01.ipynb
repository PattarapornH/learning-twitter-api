    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a tool that makes the interaction with computer programs and web services easy. Many web services provides APIs to developers to interact with their services and to access data in programmatic way. For this programming experiment, we will use Twitter Streaming API to download tweets related to the 2 keywords: \"**big data**\", and \"**data analytic**\".\n",
    "### Step 1: Getting Twitter API keys\n",
    "In order to access Twitter Streaming API, we need to get 4 pieces of information from Twitter: *API key*, *API secret*, *Access token* and *Access token secret*. Follow the steps below to get all these 4 elements:\n",
    "* Create a twitter account if you do not already have one.\n",
    "* Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and log in with your twitter credentials.\n",
    "* Click \"Create New App\"\n",
    "* Fill out the form, agree to the terms, and click \"Create your Twitter application\"\n",
    "* In the next page, click on \"API keys\" tab, and copy your \"API key\" and \"API secret\".\n",
    "* Scroll down and click \"Create my access token\", and copy your \"Access token\" and \"Access token secret\"."
